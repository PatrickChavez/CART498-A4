## User Guide

Simply type in a dreamlike scenario. In addition, the user should input at least one Jungian keyword and archetype. A list of terms can be found by hovering over the instructions found in the app.

## Jungian Reflection

Most of the ideas and aesthetics of the web app were based on [an article written by Laura Copley, Ph.D. on Positive Psychology](https://positivepsychology.com/jungian-archetypes/). The article in question gives the reader a basic overview of Jungian terms and archetypes. After skimming through the text, I decided that I wanted to convey a sense of “shadowed unconsciousness” in the visuals. To this end, I made an animated background depicting a photo of Carl Jung along with the four main archetypes of his philosophy (according to the web article): the self, the persona, the shadow and the animus. The idea was that I wanted to quickly convey to the viewer the main ideas of Jung’s philosophy in a single visual (although depending on the viewport, the terms could be obscured). The “TV static” effect was used in order to give the website a feeling of mysteriousness, as if stumbling into a dream or nightmare. There is also the use of warm and cool colors in the text; any description that alludes to dreaming is colored blue in order to convey the detached nature of the “unconscious”. Conversely, the “submit” button is given warm colors to represent the viewer’s “conscious” decision to activate their prompt.

## Possible Improvements

One aspect that I wish I could change is the robustness of “gpt-image-1-
mini”. According to Google Gemini, an image model generator is unable to have a “developer role” like a text generator, meaning that depicting a “Jungian dreamscape” must be done via a prompt from the user. This restriction is why I decided to include terms and archetypes in the web app instructions. Ideally, I would like to create a situation where the image model can generate an image with Jungian concepts without the need for the user to type in keywords.

I would have also like to work more on the aesthetics of the web app; maybe I could have made the video background more responsive by changing its color when the image is generated. The instructions could have also been clickable so the viewer could get a pop-up modal with a list of terms; that way, the viewer can simply copy and paste the term they want to use.
